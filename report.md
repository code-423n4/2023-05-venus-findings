# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Venus Protocol Isolated Pools smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between May 8 - May 15 2023.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/8be784ed9752b80e6f1b8b781e2e6251748d0d7e/contracts/WhitePaperInterestRateModel.sol#L17>

The interest rate per block is **5x** greater than it's intended to be for markets that use the Whitepaper interest rate model.

### Proof of Concept

The `WhitePaperInterestRateModel` contract is forked from Compound Finance, which was designed to be deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. The `blocksPerYear` constant inside the contract is used to calculate the interest rate of the market on a per-block basis and is set to **2102400**, which assumes that there are 365 days a year and that the block-time is **15 seconds**.

However, Venus Protocol is deployed on the BNB chain, which has a block-time of only **3 seconds**. This results in the interest rate per block on the BNB chain to be **5x** greater than intended.

Both `baseRatePerBlock` and `multiplierPerBlock` are affected and are **5x** the value they should be. This also implies that the pool's interest rate is also 5 times more sensitive to utilization rate changes than intended. It is impossible for the market to arbitrage and adjust the interest rate back to the intended rate as seen in the PoC graph below. It's likely that arbitrageurs will deposit as much collateral as possible to take advantage of the high supply rate, leading to a utilization ratio close to 0.

The following Python script plots the `WhitePaperInterestRateModel` curves for a 15 second and a 3 second block time.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
BASE = 1e18

# Solidity functions converted to Python functions
def utilization_rate(cash, borrows, reserves):
    if borrows == 0:
        return 0
    return (borrows * BASE) / (cash + borrows - reserves)

def get_borrow_rate(ur, base_rate_per_block, multiplier_per_block):
    return ((ur * multiplier_per_block) / BASE) + base_rate_per_block

def generate_data_points(base_rate_per_year, multiplier_per_year, blocks_per_year, cash, borrows, reserves):
    base_rate_per_block = base_rate_per_year / blocks_per_year
    multiplier_per_block = multiplier_per_year / blocks_per_year

    utilization_rates = [i / 100 for i in range(101)]
    borrow_rates = [get_borrow_rate(ur * BASE, base_rate_per_block, multiplier_per_block) for ur in utilization_rates]

    return utilization_rates, borrow_rates

# User inputs
base_rate_per_year = 5e16 # 5%
multiplier_per_year = 1e16 # 1%
blocks_per_year1 = 2102400 # 15 second block-time
blocks_per_year2 = 10512000 # 3 second block-time

# Example values for cash, borrows, and reserves
cash = 1e18
borrows = 5e18
reserves = 0.1e18

# Generate data points for both curves
utilization_rates1, borrow_rates1 = generate_data_points(base_rate_per_year, multiplier_per_year, blocks_per_year1, cash, borrows, reserves)
utilization_rates2, borrow_rates2 = generate_data_points(base_rate_per_year, multiplier_per_year, blocks_per_year2, cash, borrows, reserves)

# Plot both curves on the same plot with a key
plt.plot(utilization_rates1, borrow_rates1, label=f"Blocks per year: {blocks_per_year1}")
plt.plot(utilization_rates2, borrow_rates2, label=f"Blocks per year: {blocks_per_year2}")
plt.xlabel("Utilization Rate")
plt.ylabel("Borrow Rate")
plt.title("Interest Rate Curves")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Result:

![Interest Rate Per Block](https://i.imgur.com/0rotxUn.png)

As seen above, the borrow rate curves are different and do not intersect. Hence, it's impossible via arbitrage for market participants to adjust the rate back to its intended value.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Fix the `blocksPerYear` constant so that it accurately describes the number of blocks a year on the BNB chain, which has a block-time of 15 seconds. The correct value is **10512000**.

```math
\begin{aligned}
\text{blocksPerYear} &= \frac{\text{secondsInAYear}}{\text{blockTime}} \\
&= \frac{365 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60}{3} \\
&= 10{,}512{,}000
\end{aligned}
```

# Medium Risk Findings (16)
## [[M-01] Malicious actor can win an auction unfavorably to the protocol by block stuffing](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/525)
*Submitted by [DeliChainSec](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/525)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L158-L202><br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L467-L470><br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L213>

When the protocol bad debt is auctioned off with 10% incentive at the beginning, a user who gives the best bid wins. The auction ends when at least one account placed a bid, and the current block number is bigger than `nextBidderBlockLimit`:

```jsx
function closeAuction(address comptroller) external nonReentrant {
        Auction storage auction = auctions[comptroller];

        require(_isStarted(auction), "no on-going auction");
        require(
            block.number > auction.highestBidBlock + nextBidderBlockLimit && auction.highestBidder != address(0),
            "waiting for next bidder. cannot close auction"
        );
```

`nextBidderBlockLimit` is set to 10 in the initializer, which means that other users have only 30 seconds to place a better bid. This is a serious problem because stuffing a whole block with dummy transactions is very cheap on Binance Smart Chain. According to <https://www.cryptoneur.xyz/en/gas-fees-calculator>, 15M gas - whole block - costs `$`14\~`$`15 on BSC. This makes a malicious user occasionally cheaply prohibit other users to overbid them, winning the auction at the least favorable price for the protocol. Because BSC is a centralized blockchain, there are no private mempools and bribes directly to the miners (like in FlashBots); hence, other users are very limited concerning the prohibitive actions.

### Impact

The protocol overpays for bad debt, losing value.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Pool gathered `$`100,000 in bad debt and it's eligible for auction.
2.  A malicious user frontruns others and places the first bid with the least possible amount (bad debt + 10% incentive).
3.  The user sends dozens of dummy transactions with increased gas prices, only to fill up whole block space for 11 blocks.
4.  At the end, the user sends a transaction to close the auction, getting the bad debt + 10% incentive.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There are at least three options to resolve this issue:

1.  Make the bidding window much higher at the beginning; like 1000 blocks.
2.  Make the bidding window very high at the beginning and decrease it; the more attractive the new bid is.
3.  Make the bidding window dependent on the money at stake, to disincentivize block stuffing.

Incorrect `borrowBalance` and token collateral values. This could lead to many different exploits, such as:

*   Users with a collateral token that fell substantially in price can borrow another underlying token, whose price has not been updated, and earn profit.
*   Users can borrow/redeem/transfer more if the interest/price was not updated.

### Proof of Concept

In the `Comptroller`, the total collateral balance and borrow balance are calculated at `_getHypotheticalLiquiditySnapshot(...)`. This function calculates these balances in the following loop:

    for (uint256 i; i < assetsCount; ++i) {
        VToken asset = assets[i];

        // Read the balances and exchange rate from the vToken
        (uint256 vTokenBalance, uint256 borrowBalance, uint256 exchangeRateMantissa) = _safeGetAccountSnapshot(
            asset,
            account
        );

        // Get the normalized price of the asset
        Exp memory oraclePrice = Exp({ mantissa: _safeGetUnderlyingPrice(asset) });

        // Pre-compute conversion factors from vTokens -> usd
        Exp memory vTokenPrice = mul_(Exp({ mantissa: exchangeRateMantissa }), oraclePrice);
        Exp memory weightedVTokenPrice = mul_(weight(asset), vTokenPrice);

        // weightedCollateral += weightedVTokenPrice * vTokenBalance
        snapshot.weightedCollateral = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(
            weightedVTokenPrice,
            vTokenBalance,
            snapshot.weightedCollateral
        );

        // totalCollateral += vTokenPrice * vTokenBalance
        snapshot.totalCollateral = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vTokenPrice, vTokenBalance, snapshot.totalCollateral);

        // borrows += oraclePrice * borrowBalance
        snapshot.borrows = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(oraclePrice, borrowBalance, snapshot.borrows);

        // Calculate effects of interacting with vTokenModify
        if (asset == vTokenModify) {
            // redeem effect
            // effects += tokensToDenom * redeemTokens
            snapshot.effects = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(weightedVTokenPrice, redeemTokens, snapshot.effects);

            // borrow effect
            // effects += oraclePrice * borrowAmount
            snapshot.effects = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(oraclePrice, borrowAmount, snapshot.effects);
        }
    }

As seen, the oracle price is not updated via calling `updatePrice(...)`, nor is the borrow interest updated by calling `AccrueInterest(...)`. Only the corresponding `VToken` that called the `borrow(...)`, `transfer(...)` or `redeem(...)` has an updated price and interest, which could lead to critical inaccuracies for accounts with several VTokens.

### Tools Used

Vscode, Hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update the price and interest of every collateral, except the VToken that triggered the hook which has already been updated. Similarly to what is being done on `healAccount(...)`:

    for (uint256 i; i < userAssetsCount; ++i) {
       userAssets[i].accrueInterest();
       oracle.updatePrice(address(userAssets[i]));
    }

### Assessed type

Oracle

>Oracle price of every market is updated on every action involving directly that market. We didn't update the prices of every market (secondarily) used in some operations to save gas, assuming the price would be valid (there are mechanisms in the Oracles to avoid the use of old prices). We'll monitor this topic to decide if our approach is enough or if we have to update the price of every market every time we invoke `_getHypotheticalLiquiditySnapshot`.

If no one invokes this update function for an asset later used indirectly by another user, and the difference between the price offered by the TWAP oracle and the rest of the oracles (i.e. Chainlink) is greater than a threshold configure in our Oracle system, the TX will be also reverted. Could this generate a DoS? I suppose that potentially it can do it, but as soon as a user interacts with the "staled" asset in Venus the block will disappear.

## [[M-03] liquidateAccount will fail if the transaction is not included in the current block](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/365)
*Submitted by [xuwinnie](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/365), also found by [Udsen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/545), [mussucal](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/195) and [BoltzmannBrain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/156)*.

Functon `liquidateAccount` will fail if the transaction is not included in the current block because interest accrues per block, and `repayAmount` and `borrowBalance` need to match precisely.

### Proof of Concept

At the end of the function `liquidateAccount`, a check is performed to ensure that the `borrowBalance` is zero:

    for (uint256 i; i < marketsCount; ++i) {
            (, uint256 borrowBalance, ) = _safeGetAccountSnapshot(borrowMarkets[i], borrower);
            require(borrowBalance == 0, "Nonzero borrow balance after liquidation");
    }

This means that `repayAmount` specified in calldata must exactly match the `borrowBalance` call. (If `repayAmount` is greater than `borrowBalance`, `Comptroller.preLiquidateHook` will revert with the error `TooMuchRepay`.) However, the `borrowBalance` updates every block due to interest accrual. The liquidator cannot be certain that their transaction will be included in the current block or in a future block. This uncertainty significantly increases the likelihood of liquidation failure.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a looser check:

    snapshot = _getCurrentLiquiditySnapshot(borrower, _getLiquidationThreshold);
    require (snapshot.shortfall == 0);

to replace:

    for (uint256 i; i < marketsCount; ++i) {
            (, uint256 borrowBalance, ) = _safeGetAccountSnapshot(borrowMarkets[i], borrower);
            require(borrowBalance == 0, "Nonzero borrow balance after liquidation");
    }

## [[M-04] `_ensureMaxLoops` causes liquidateAccount to fail in certain conditions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/327)
*Submitted by [xuwinnie](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/327), also found by [0x8chars](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/428)*.

The function `_ensureMaxLoops` reverts if the iteration count exceeds the `maxLoopsLimit`. However, the limitation imposed by `maxLoopsLimit` hinders the functioning of `liquidateAccount` under certain conditions, as `orderCount` needs to reach twice the market count (which is also constrained by the `maxLoopsLimit`) in extreme cases.

### Proof of Concept

Suppose `maxLoopsLimit` is set to **16** and currently **12** markets have been added, which is allowed by `_ensureMaxLoops` in function `_addMarket`:

    allMarkets.push(VToken(vToken));
    marketsCount = allMarkets.length;
    _ensureMaxLoops(marketsCount);

Then, Alice enters all **12** markets by depositing and borrowing simultaneously, which is also allowed by `_ensureMaxLoops` in function `enterMarkets`:

    uint256 len = vTokens.length;
    uint256 accountAssetsLen = accountAssets[msg.sender].length;
    _ensureMaxLoops(accountAssetsLen + len);

To illustrate, assume these **12** coins are all stablecoin with an equal value. Let's call them USDA - USDL. Alice deposits 20 USDA, 1.1 USDB - 1.1 USDL, worth 32.1 USD in total. Then she borrows 2 USDA - 2 USDL, worth 24 USD in total. Unluckily, USDA de-pegs to 0.6 USD and Alice's deposit value drops to 24.1 USD, which is below the liquidation threshold (also below the `minLiquidatableCollateral`). However, nobody can liquidate Alice's account by calling `liquidateAccount`, because the least possible `orderCount` is **23**, which exceeds `maxLoopsLimit`.

Let's take a closer look at `LiquidationOrder`:

    struct LiquidationOrder {
           VToken vTokenCollateral;
           VToken vTokenBorrowed;
           uint256 repayAmount;
    }

In this case, the liquidator cannot perfectly match `vTokenCollateral` with `vTokenBorrowed` one-to-one. Because the value of collateral and debt is not equal, more than one order is needed to liquidate each asset. To generalize, if the asset count is **n**, in the worst case, **2n-1** orders are needed for a complete liquidation (not hard to prove).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

    _ensureMaxLoops(ordersCount / 2);

### Assessed type

## [[M-05] Bad Debt in PoolLens.sol#getPoolBadDebt() is not calculated correctly in USD](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/316)
*Submitted by [peanuts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/316), also found by [jasonxiale](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/385), [0xStalin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/274) and [volodya](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/40)*.

### Proof of Concept

In `PoolLens.sol#getPoolBadDebt()`, bad debt is calculated as such:

                badDebt.badDebtUsd =
                    VToken(address(markets[i])).badDebt() *
                    priceOracle.getUnderlyingPrice(address(markets[i]));
                badDebtSummary.badDebts[i] = badDebt;
                totalBadDebtUsd = totalBadDebtUsd + badDebt.badDebtUsd;

In `Shortfall.sol#\_startAuction()`, bad debt is calculated as such:

            uint256[] memory marketsDebt = new uint256[](marketsCount);
            auction.markets = new VToken[](marketsCount);

            for (uint256 i; i < marketsCount; ++i) {
                uint256 marketBadDebt = vTokens[i].badDebt();

                priceOracle.updatePrice(address(vTokens[i]));
                uint256 usdValue = (priceOracle.getUnderlyingPrice(address(vTokens[i])) * marketBadDebt) / 1e18;

                poolBadDebt = poolBadDebt + usdValue;

Focus on the line with the `priceOracle.getUnderlyingPrice`. In `PoolLens.sol#getPoolBadDebt`, `badDebt` in USD is calculated by multiplying the bad debt of the VToken market by the underlying price. However, in `Shortfall`, `badDebt` in USD is calculated by the bad debt of the VToken market by the underlying price and divided by 1e18.

The `PoolLens#getPoolBadDebt()` function doesn't divide the debt in USD by 1e18.

This is what the function is actually counting:

Let's say that the VToken market has a `badDebt` of 1.3 ETH (1e18 ETH). The pool intends to calculate 1.3 ETH in terms of USD, so it calls the oracle to determine the price of ETH. Let's say the price of ETH is 1500 USD. The total pool debt should be 1.3 &ast; 1500 = 1950 USD. In decimal calculation, the pool debt should be 1.3e18 &ast; 1500e18 (if oracle returns in 18 decimal places) / 1e18 = 1950e18.

The badDebt in USD in `PoolLens.sol#getPoolBadDebt()` will be massively inflated.

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Normalize the decimals of the bad debt calculation in `getPoolBadDebt()`.

                badDebt.badDebtUsd =
                    VToken(address(markets[i])).badDebt() *
    +               priceOracle.getUnderlyingPrice(address(markets[i])) / 1e18;
                badDebtSummary.badDebts[i] = badDebt;
                totalBadDebtUsd = totalBadDebtUsd + badDebt.badDebtUsd;

## [[M-06] Potential Unjust Liquidation After Exiting Market ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/309)
*Submitted by [0xcm](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/309), also found by [thekmj](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/571) and [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/67)*.

Users might face unjust liquidation of their assets even after exiting a particular market. This could lead to potential financial losses for users, and it might undermine the trust and reputation of the platform.

### Proof of Concept

Consider a user with the following financial status:

*   Collateral: 1 Bitcoin (BTC), worth `$`30,000, and 10,000 USDT, worth `$`10,000.
*   Outstanding loan: 1 Ethereum (ETH), worth `$`3,000.

1.  The user decides to remove their risk from BTC volatility and exits the BTC market. As per the protocol's rules, exiting the market should remove BTC from their collateral.

2.  Following the user's exit from the BTC market, a sharp rise in the ETH price occurs, and it surpasses `$`10,000.

3.  Due to the increase in ETH price, the system identifies that the user's collateral (now only 10,000 USDT) is insufficient to cover their loan, leading to an insufficient collateralization rate.

4.  Despite the user's exit from the BTC market, the system still triggers a liquidation process to liquidate BTC as collateral.

In reality, if the BTC was still part of the user's collateral, the total collateral value would have been `$`40,000 (`$`30,000 from BTC and `$`10,000 from USDT). This total value would be sufficient to cover the ETH loan even with the price surge of ETH. Therefore, the user should not have faced liquidation.

This can be traced back to the missing membership check in `preLiquidateHook` function which does not consider if the user has exited the market or not.

## [[M-07] DOS attack prevents refunding previous bid in Shortfall.sol and malicious bidder always wins the auction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/305)
*Submitted by [berlin-101](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/305), also found by [Emmanuel](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/472), [YungChaza](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/461), [Emmanuel](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/412), [sashik\_eth](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/376), [Team\_Rocket](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/323), [fs0c](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/227), [fs0c](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/226), [Audit\_Avengers\_2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/194), [0xadrii](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/124) and [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/63)*.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L183> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L190>

The auction logic in `Shortfall.sol` refunds the previously accepted (highest) bid when a new acceptable bid is placed via the `placeBid` function.

It is important that this refund succeeds as otherwise a new acceptable (higher) bid is not possible and the auction is disrupted which consequently makes the current highest bidder the auction winner and causes a loss for the Venus project and its users.

When refunding the `safeTransfer` of OpenZeppelin `SafeERC20Upgradeable` (inheriting from `SafeERC20`) is used which deals with the multiple ways in which different ERC-20 (BEP-20) tokens indicate the success/failure of a token transfer.

For details see: <https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L12>

Nevertheless, there are additional scenarios that may still disrupt the auction and put it into a state of DOS (Denial of Service). Specifically, 2 scenarios were identified:

1.  DOS with the underlying token implementing a blacklist.
2.  DOS with the underlying token being an ERC20-compatible ERC777 token.

### Proof of Concept

### 1. DOS with the underlying token implementing a blacklist

In this scenario, the underlying token is implemented with a blacklist (also known as blocklist).

Because this is common for tokens on the Ethereum network (e.g. USDC/USDT implementing blacklist/blocklist; See: <https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20>) this is a scenario also possible for tokens on the Binance Chain.

And since it is not specifically stated that such tokens are excluded from the Venus project, while the fee on transfer/deflationary/rebase tokens are specifically mentioned to be excluded, this is assumed to be a potential issue.

The following steps describe the issue:

1.  Bidder 1 makes a bid while he is not on the token blacklist.
2.  After the bid, he is put on the token blacklist.
3.  Bidder 2 makes a higher bid and the refund to bidder 1 is attempted.
4.  The refund reverts due to bidder 1 being blacklisted which blocks the token transfer back.
5.  Bidder 1 remains the highest bidder and wins the auction.

### 2. DOS with the underlying token being an ERC20-compatible ERC777 token.

In this scenario, the underlying token is an ER777 token instead of an ERC20. Since the audit does not specifically state that ERC777 tokens (which are ERC-20 compatible) are out of scope, this is assumed to be a potential issue.

See <https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc777> for details on ERC777 tokens.

The following steps describe the issue:

1.  Bidder 1 implements a contract that acts as an "ERC777 recipient" which can either accept/reject tokens that are transferred to it.
2.  Bidder 1 makes a bid not with an EOA (externally owned account) but uses his smart contract to make the bid.
3.  After the bid was accepted, he activates his smart contract and rejects any tokens transferred to it.
4.  Bidder 2 makes a higher bid and the refund to the smart contract of bidder 1 is attempted.
5.  The refund fails due to the smart contract of bidder 1 rejecting the token transfer (ERC777 token calls `tokensReceived` function of receiving a smart contract to finalize the token transfer which reverts).
6.  Bidder 1 remains the highest bidder and wins the auction.

### Coded POC

To prove both aforementioned scenarios of putting the auction into a state of DOS, the `Shortfall.ts` test was modified and 1 test case for each scenario was added. Code for additional required mock tokens etc. (`MockTokenERC20Blacklistable.sol`, `MockTokenERC777.sol`, `ERC777Recipient.sol`) are included.

*Note: see [DOS attack prevents refunding previous bid in Shortfall.sol and malicious bidder always wins the auction
](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/305) for coding details.*

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a withdrawal pattern ("pull over push") instead of directly refunding the highest bidder during the bid. See: https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html for details. This way, the auction will not get into a state of DOS.

## [[M-08] Borrower can cause a DoS by frontrunning a liquidation and repaying as low as 1 wei of the current debt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/255)
*Submitted by [0xStalin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/255), also found by [J4de](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/443) and [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/121)*.

Borrowers can cause DoS when the liquidator attempts to liquidate 100% of the borrower's position.
The borrower needs to frontrun the liquidation tx and repay a slight portion of the debt, paying as low as 1 wei will make the [borrowBalance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L446) to be less than what it was when the liquidator sent the tx to liquidate the position.

### Proof of Concept

If a liquidator intends to liquidate the entire position, but the borrower frontruns the liquidator's transaction and repays an insignificant amount of the total debt, will cause the [borrowBalance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L446) to be less than it was when the liquidator sent its transaction; thus, will cause the value of the [maxClose](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L469) variable to be less than the `repayAmount` that the liquidator set to liquidate the whole position, which will end up causing the tx to be reverted because of [this validation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L470-L472)

**Example:**

*   There is a position of 100 WBNB to be liquidated, the liquidator sends the `repayAmount` as whatever the `maxClose` was at that point, the borrower realizes that 100% of its position will be liquidated and then frontruns the liquidation transaction by repaying an insignificant amount of the total borrow.
*   When the liquidation transaction is executed, the `maxClose` will be calculated based on the new `borrowBalance`, which will cause the calculation of `maxClose` to be less than the total `repayAmount` that was sent, and the transaction will be reverted even though the position is still in a liquidation state

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Instead of [reverting the tx if the repayAmount is greater than maxClose](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L469-L472), recalculate the final `repayAmount` to be paid during the execution of the liquidation and return this calculated value back to the function that called the `preLiquidateHook()`.

```solidity
function preLiquidateHook(
    ...
    uint256 repayAmount,
    ...
+   ) external override returns(uint256 repayAmountFinal) {
    ...
    ...
-   if (repayAmount > maxClose) {
-      revert TooMuchRepay();
-   }
+   repayAmountFinal = repayAmount > maxClose ? maxClose : repayAmount
```

There might be an incorrect amount of transfer possible if `convertibleBaseAsset` is not a token which is pegged to USD.

There is not much information on what `convertibleBaseAsset` is supposed to be. If it is a token which is not pegged to USD, then the auction process might transfer wrong amount of tokens or entirely wrong tokens.

Let's take an example of `LARGE_RISK_FUND` type of auction for simplicity. Assuming the `convertibleBaseAsset` is not a token pegged to USD (let's take it as BNB, for this case).

Now the calculation of `poolBadDebt` is calculated by converting the `badDebt` to usd terms in the code below:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < marketsCount; ++i) {
            uint256 marketBadDebt = vTokens[i].badDebt();

            priceOracle.updatePrice(address(vTokens[i]));
            uint256 usdValue = (priceOracle.getUnderlyingPrice(address(vTokens[i])) * marketBadDebt) / 1e18;

            poolBadDebt = poolBadDebt + usdValue;
            auction.markets[i] = vTokens[i];
            auction.marketDebt[vTokens[i]] = marketBadDebt;
            marketsDebt[i] = marketBadDebt;
        }
```

In this case, the auction properties would be as follows:

```solidity
auction.seizedRiskFund = incentivizedRiskFundBalance;
auction.startBlock = block.number;
auction.status = AuctionStatus.STARTED;
auction.highestBidder = address(0);
```

Where `incentivizedRiskFundBalance` = `poolBadDebt + ((poolBadDebt * incentiveBps) / MAX_BPS);`

```solidity
function closeAuction(address comptroller) external nonReentrant {
        Auction storage auction = auctions[comptroller];
				// ...
        if (auction.auctionType == AuctionType.LARGE_POOL_DEBT) {
            riskFundBidAmount = auction.seizedRiskFund;
        } else {
            riskFundBidAmount = (auction.seizedRiskFund * auction.highestBidBps) / MAX_BPS;
        }

        uint256 transferredAmount = riskFund.transferReserveForAuction(comptroller, riskFundBidAmount);
        IERC20Upgradeable(convertibleBaseAsset).safeTransfer(auction.highestBidder, riskFundBidAmount); 
    }
```

When the `closeAuction`  is called, the contract will transfer the `riskFundBidAmount` of `convertibleBaseAsset` to the highest bidder. Here, if the `convertibleBaseAsset` token is not a token pegged to USD, it will transfer those tokens to the highest bidder, where it should have transferred the tokens that amount to that value.

Example:
 - `convertibleBaseAsset` = TokenA (the price of this token is `$`100 per 1e18 tokens).
 - `PoolBadDebt` = 200 &ast; ie18, which should be equal to `$`200 as `poolbaddebt` is calculated in USD.
 - `seizedRiskFund` = 220 &ast; 1e18.

Assume the auction type is `LARGE_RISK_FUND` and `highestBidBps` = 10000.

At the auction complete the tokens transferred to the highestbidder would be:
 - `riskFundBidAmount` = 220 &ast; 1e18 &ast; 10000/10000 = 220 &ast; 1e18
 - Actual price of tokens transferred to the highestbidder = 220 &ast; 100 = `$`22000
 - Token amount that should be transferred = `$`220.

Here, the tokens are directly transferred before converting them into the terms of `convertibleBaseAsset` which causes the main issue.

### Recommendation

Before transferring the amount to the highest bidder, ping the Oracle for the correct price of `convertibleBaseAsset` and then convert the `riskFundBidAmount` in the terms of `convertibleBaseAsset` Tokens. Even if a token pegged to USD is used, the Oracle should be used to get the correct value AND the tokens should always be converted in terms of  `convertibleBaseAsset`, as sometimes the pegged tokens might also divert from their price or decimals might be different for different tokens.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/8be784ed9752b80e6f1b8b781e2e6251748d0d7e/contracts/VToken.sol#L1463> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/8be784ed9752b80e6f1b8b781e2e6251748d0d7e/contracts/VToken.sol#L1421> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/8be784ed9752b80e6f1b8b781e2e6251748d0d7e/contracts/VToken.sol#L756>

A malicious user can manipulate the protocol to receive greater rewards from the `RewardsDistributor` than they should. To achieve this, the attacker manipulates the `exchangeRate`.

The attacker `mint`s into the `VToken` contract legitimately but also `transfer`s an amount of tokens directly to the `VToken` contract. This inflates the `exchangeRate` for all subsequent users who `mint` and has the following impact:

1.  Allows the attacker to push their leverage past the market `collateralFactor`
2.  Violates the internal accounting when `borrowing` and `repaying`, causing the `totalBorrows` and the sum of the individual account borrows to become out of sync. I.e. the `totalBorrows` can become `0` while there are still some loans outstanding, leading to loss of earned interest.
3.  The attacker can use the leverage to repeatedly `borrow` + `mint` into the `VToken` in order to inflate their share of the token rewards issued by the rewards distributor.

This means that all subsequent `minter`s receive less `VTokens` than they should.

The attack cost is the loss of the `transfer` into the `VToken` contract. But it must be noted that the attacker still receives around 65-75% of the (`attackTokens` + `mintTokens`) back.

The permanent side-effect of this exploit is that the minting of `VTokens` to any subsequent users remains stunted, as there is no direct mechanism to clear the excess underlying tokens from the contract. This can taint this Pool permanently.

This exploit becomes more profitable as block count accrues and more `REWARD_TOKENS` are issued, or, for example, if VENUS sets up greater rewards to incentivize supplying into a particular Pool; these increased rewards are a normal practice in DeFi and could be a prime target for this manipulation.

### Proof of Concept

In this scenario an attacker:

1.  Needs \~60 underlying tokens (supply 10 underlying, 20 direct transfer, 30 interest).
2.  Gets \~5 times more rewards than other users.
3.  Is still able to withdraw \~50 underlying tokens from the `VToken`.
4.  \~10 tokens are now stuck in the contract, permanently tainting the exchange rate.

A detailed Proof of Concept illustrating the case can be found in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/lokithe5th/cda577cc1b50cb91cfe1d4b1eccecc7e).

The gist simulates and walks through the attack using the repo's test suite as a base.
The exploit is commented on throughout its various steps.

### Tools Used

Manual Code Review.
Hardhat + modified tests from repo.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When contract calculations depend on calls to an `ERC20.balanceOf`, there is always a risk of a malicious user sending tokens directly to the contract to manipulate the calculations to their benefit.

The simplest solution would be to have a check that the expected amount of underlying is equal to the actual amount of underlying, and if not, have the `mint` function sweep these additional underlying tokens into the next `minter's` calculations, reducing the economic incentive and eliminating the exaggerated effect on the exchange rate.

In the preceeding code these users tried repay their borrows using their exact `borrowBalance` from the call to `VToken.getAccountSnapshot(user)`. It would be acceptable for a user to assume that should they try to `repayBorrow` with this outstanding amount. If memory serves, this failure of repayment using the returned `borrowBalance` happened in exchange manipulation scenarios, but not others. But this may have been a mistaken assumption if that is not the case. If so, it would also be a separate issue.

>I think that is not precise. The donation doesn't allow users to break the rule of the collateral factor. The donation is increasing the value of the `vTokens`, so any user with `vTokens` before the donation will be able to borrow more tokens. That is correct, expected, and doesn't generate any issue.
>
>You call it manipulation, and I can see your point because with a donation the user is able to change the value of the exchange rate. Personally, I don't think this is a manipulation, because the user doesn't get any benefit by doing it. As I said, if the attacker mints instead of donating the same amount, he would be able to borrow more tokens (in a regular scenario, not being the first and only supplier).
>
>Example:
>* Initial exchange rate: 1 (1 underlying token == 1 `vToken`)

>* Attacker 1 mints 1,000 tokens, receiving 1,000 `vTokens`. Exchange rate is not affected, so, it's 1
>* Attacker 1 donates 2,000 tokens, not receiving anything, but changing the exchange rate, that now will be 2 (total cash / total `vTokens` minted)
>
>So, now the 1,000 `vTokens` have more value (the attacker would be able to redeem 1,000 `vTokens` and receive 2,000 tokens, instead of the original 1,000 tokens they minted). And therefore, the "borrowing power" of the attacker is greater. The attacker can borrow more assets from another market, because now his 1,000 `vTokens` has more value.
>
>But, that is a bad strategy by the attacker, because by doing the donation User 1 also received a benefit. Now, User 1 can redeem their 1,000 `vTokens`, receiving 2,000 tokens. Not only their original 1,000 tokens.
>
>A better strategy by the attacker would be to mint 2,000 tokens, instead of donating them. This way, the exchange rate doesn't change (so User 1 doesn't receive any benefit) and the "borrowing power" of the attacker is even higher (3,000 tokens, instead of 2,000 tokens achieved via the donation).
>
>So, yes, with a donation you are able to update the exchange rate, but you won't get any benefit, and you will lose resources.
>
>> Indeed, rounding in Solidity is a known issue. It may well be that the direct transfer only served to exacerbate this issue when compared with the control scenario.

>If you mint instead of donating, the rounding issue appears too. So, I don't think the donation exacerbates the rounding issue.

>In the Venus protocol, I think donations benefit every `vToken` holder and don't affect future holders, because for a user getting `vTokens`, the relevant events happen from the `vTokens` are minted until they are redeemed. It doesn't matter what happened before. Moreover, the exchange rate is never decreasing. So, IMO, we can avoid the internal tracking of cash in the markets.

I think the impact is low because users are not able to repay 100% of their debt only in edge cases, with 1 or 2 borrowers in the market and after several blocks. With a regular number of borrowers, users shouldn't have any problem repaying their debt, and therefore redeeming their `vTokens`

## [[M-11] `RiskFund.swapPoolsAsset` does not allow the user to supply deadline, which may cause swap revert](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/167)
*Submitted by [0xnev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/167), also found by [0xStalin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/522), [BugBusters](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/304) and [chaieth](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/233)*.

Not allowing users to supply their own deadline could potentially expose them to sandwich attacks.

### Proof of Concept

[RiskFund.sol#L174](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/RiskFund/RiskFund.sol#L174)

```solidity
function swapPoolsAssets(
    address[] calldata markets,
    uint256[] calldata amountsOutMin,
    address[][] calldata paths
) external override returns (uint256) {
    _checkAccessAllowed("swapPoolsAssets(address[],uint256[],address[][])");
    require(poolRegistry != address(0), "Risk fund: Invalid pool registry.");
    require(markets.length == amountsOutMin.length, "Risk fund: markets and amountsOutMin are unequal lengths");
    require(markets.length == paths.length, "Risk fund: markets and paths are unequal lengths");

    uint256 totalAmount;
    uint256 marketsCount = markets.length;

    _ensureMaxLoops(marketsCount);

    for (uint256 i; i < marketsCount; ++i) {
        VToken vToken = VToken(markets[i]);
        address comptroller = address(vToken.comptroller());

        PoolRegistry.VenusPool memory pool = PoolRegistry(poolRegistry).getPoolByComptroller(comptroller);
        require(pool.comptroller == comptroller, "comptroller doesn't exist pool registry");
        require(Comptroller(comptroller).isMarketListed(vToken), "market is not listed");

        uint256 swappedTokens = _swapAsset(vToken, comptroller, amountsOutMin[i], paths[i]);
        poolReserves[comptroller] = poolReserves[comptroller] + swappedTokens;
        totalAmount = totalAmount + swappedTokens;
    }

    emit SwappedPoolsAssets(markets, amountsOutMin, totalAmount);

    return totalAmount;
}
```

In `RiskFund.swapPoolsAsset`, there is a parameter to allow users to supply slippage through `amountOutMin`, but does not allow the user to include a deadline check when swapping pool assets into base assets, in the event that pool assets are not equal to `convertibleBaseAsset`.

```solidity
uint256 swappedTokens = _swapAsset(vToken, comptroller, amountsOutMin[i], paths[i]);
```

In `RiskFund._swapAsset`, there is a call to `IPancakeswapV2Router(pancakeSwapRouter).swapExactTokensForTokens()`, but the `deadline` parameter is simply passed in as the current `block.timestamp`, in which the transaction occurs. This effectively means that the transaction has no deadline, which means that swap transactions may be included anytime by validators and remain pending in mempool, potentially exposing users to sandwich attacks by attackers or MEV bots.

[RiskFund.sol#L265](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/RiskFund/RiskFund.sol#L265)

```solidity
function _swapAsset(
    VToken vToken,
    address comptroller,
    uint256 amountOutMin,
    address[] calldata path
) internal returns (uint256) 
            ...
            ...
            if (underlyingAsset != convertibleBaseAsset) {
                require(path[0] == underlyingAsset, "RiskFund: swap path must start with the underlying asset");
                require(
                    path[path.length - 1] == convertibleBaseAsset,
                    "RiskFund: finally path must be convertible base asset"
                );
                IERC20Upgradeable(underlyingAsset).safeApprove(pancakeSwapRouter, 0);
                IERC20Upgradeable(underlyingAsset).safeApprove(pancakeSwapRouter, balanceOfUnderlyingAsset);
                uint256[] memory amounts = IPancakeswapV2Router(pancakeSwapRouter).swapExactTokensForTokens(
                    balanceOfUnderlyingAsset,
                    amountOutMin,
                    path,
                    address(this),
                    /// @audit does not allow deadline to be passed in by user
                    block.timestamp
                );
                ...
                ...
```

Consider the following scenario:

1.  Alice wants to swap 30 vBNB tokens for 1 BNB and later sell the 1 BNB for 300 DAI. She signs the transaction calling `RiskFund.swapPoolsAsset()` with inputAmount = 30 vBNB and `amountOutmin` = 0.99 BNB to allow for 1% slippage.
2. The transaction is submitted to the mempool; however, Alice chose a transaction fee that is too low for validators to be interested in including her transaction in a block. The transaction stays pending in the mempool for extended periods, which could be hours, days, weeks, or even longer.
3. When the average gas fee dropped far enough for Alice's transaction to become interesting again for miners to include it, her swap will be executed. In the meantime, the price of BNB could have drastically decreased. She will still at least get 0.99 BNB due to `amountOutmin`, but the DAI value of that output might be significantly lower. She has unknowingly performed a bad trade due to the pending transaction she forgot about.

An even worse way this issue can be maliciously exploited is through MEV:

1.  The swap transaction is still pending in the mempool. Average fees are still too high for validators to be interested in it. The price of BNB has gone up significantly since the transaction was signed, meaning Alice would receive a lot more ETH when the swap is executed. But that also means that her `minOutput` value is outdated and would allow for significant slippage.
2. A MEV bot detects the pending transaction. Since the outdated `minOut` now allows for high slippage, the bot sandwiches Alice, resulting in significant profit for the bot and significant loss for Alice.

Manual Analysis

### Recommendation

Allow users to supply their own deadline parameter within `RiskFund.swapPoolsAsset`.

## [[M-12] Fix utilization rate computation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/122)
*Submitted by [SaeedAlipoor01988](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/122), also found by [lanrebayode77](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/159)*.

The `BaseJumpRateModelV2.sol#L131.utilizationRate()` function can return a value above 1 and not between [0, BASE].

### Proof of Concept

In the `BaseJumpRateModelV2.sol#L131.utilizationRate()` function, cash and borrows and reserves values get used to calculate the utilization rate between [0, 1e18]. Reserves are currently unused but it will be used in the future.

     */
    function utilizationRate(
        uint256 cash,
        uint256 borrows,
        uint256 reserves
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
        // Utilization rate is 0 when there are no borrows
        if (borrows == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        return (borrows * BASE) / (cash + borrows - reserves);
    }

If the borrow value is 0, then the function will return 0, but in this function, the scenario where the value of reserves exceeds cash is not handled. The system does not guarantee that reserves never exceed cash. The reserves grow automatically over time, so it might be difficult to avoid this entirely.

If reserves > cash (and borrows + cash - reserves > 0), the formula for `utilizationRate` above gives a utilization rate above 1.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Make the utilization rate computation return 1 if reserves > cash.

## [[M-13] Comptroller.healAccount doesn't distribute rewards for a healed borrower](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/116)
*Submitted by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/116)*.

As a result, the healed account receives less rewards.

### Proof of Concept

`Comptroller.healAccount` can be called by anyone in order to fully close accounts. The healer should repay part of account's debt in order to receive all account's collateral. At the end account debt will be cleared.

This is the part when collateral is seized and debt is cleared: <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L611-L625>

```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < userAssetsCount; ++i) {
            VToken market = userAssets[i];

            (uint256 tokens, uint256 borrowBalance, ) = _safeGetAccountSnapshot(market, user);
            uint256 repaymentAmount = mul_ScalarTruncate(percentage, borrowBalance);

            // Seize the entire collateral
            if (tokens != 0) {
                market.seize(liquidator, user, tokens);
            }
            // Repay a certain percentage of the borrow, forgive the rest
            if (borrowBalance != 0) {
                market.healBorrow(liquidator, user, repaymentAmount);
            }
        }
```

In order to seize the collateral, `market.seize` is called, which will then [call `comptroller.preSeizeHook`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VToken.sol#L1104). And this hook [will distribute supply rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L521-L525) to both accounts.

In order to clear, healed account debt `market.healBorrow` is called. This function [will not call any comptroller function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VToken.sol#L390-L429). As a result, the debt of the healed account is set to 0, but rewards that were earned by the account before healing were not distributed. So the user lost rewards for that debt amount.

### Tools Used

VsCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`Comptroller` should distribute rewards to this account that were earned before and only then set debt to 0.

## [[M-14] placeBid() Possible participation in auctions that have been modified](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/62)
*Submitted by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/62)*

`placeBid()` lacks checking if auctions are restarted and participated in that are not expected by the user, which may result in the user losing funds.

### Proof of Concept

When the user makes a bid, simply pass in `comptroller` and `bidBps` with the following code:

```solidity
    function placeBid(address comptroller, uint256 bidBps) external nonReentrant {
        Auction storage auction = auctions[comptroller];

        require(_isStarted(auction), "no on-going auction");
        require(!_isStale(auction), "auction is stale, restart it");
        require(bidBps <= MAX_BPS, "basis points cannot be more than 10000");
```

Because `comptroller` corresponds to the `Auction` there are two cases that will generate new `Auction` (the new one and the old one may have completely different types and amounts):

1.  If the first auction takes too long and no one bids, `_isStale()` can restart the auction.
2.  If the auction ends and the last bid time `>nextBidderBlockLimit`, then you can restart the auction after it ends.

Since bidding can be restarted, `placeBid()` is only based on `comptroller`, and it may be possible to participate in the old `Auction`, but end up participating in the new `Auction`; as the old and new `Auction` may be very different, resulting in the user losing money.

For example:

1.  Alice learns about the auction in the UI, auctions = `{type=LARGE_RISK_FUND,debt=100,seizedRiskFund=100}` and submits it to participate in the auction.
2.  When Alice commits, her transaction will exist in memorypool.

    *Note: Because Alice needs to stay in the UI interface for some time, or because of the GAS price and block size, Alice's transaction is delayed, resulting in a much higher possibility of preemptive execution in step 3:*

3.  The auction is restarted due to any of the following situations (before Alice's task is executed):

    a) Auction `>waitForFirstBidder` leads to `_isStale()`. Bob executes restarted auction, restarted auction debt increases. E.g.: auction = `{type=LARGE_POOL_DEBT,debt=100000,seizedRiskFund=100}`.

    b) The auction ends `>nextBidderBlockLimit`. Bob restarts the auction, and the restarted auction `seizedRiskFund` becomes small, like 0, the debt is already very high as
auction = `{type=LARGE_POOL_DEBT,debt=100,seizedRiskFund=0}`, there may also be still `LARGE_RISK_FUND`.

4.  Alice's turn to execute the transaction, this time the new auction, and Alice expected has been much worse, but the transaction will still be executed. The result is that Alice may pay a lot of debt, but get very little `seizedRiskFund`.

So, we need to add a restriction to `placeBid()` to ensure that the auction has not been restarted when the transaction is executed.

A simple way to do this is to add the parameter: `auctionStartBlock`, and compare it to the `auction.startBlock` of the current transaction. If the two are different, then the auction has been restarted and the transaction reverts.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```solidity
-   function placeBid(address comptroller, uint256 bidBps) external nonReentrant {
+   function placeBid(address comptroller, uint256 bidBps , uint256 auctionStartBlock) external nonReentrant {    
        Auction storage auction = auctions[comptroller];

+       require(auction.startBlock == auctionStartBlock,"auction has been restarted");
        require(_isStarted(auction), "no on-going auction");
        require(!_isStale(auction), "auction is stale, restart it");
        require(bidBps <= MAX_BPS, "basis points cannot be more than 10000");
```

Borrow rates are calculated dynamically and `VToken.accrueInterest()` [reverts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VToken.sol#L695-L696) if the calculated rate is greater than a hard-coded maximum. As `accrueInterest()` is called by most VToken functions, this state causes a major DoS.

### Proof of Concept

VToken [hard-codes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VTokenInterfaces.sol#L53) the maximum borrow rate and `accrueInterest()` [reverts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VToken.sol#L695-L696) if the dynamically calculated rate is greater than the hard-coded value.

The actual calculation is dynamic [[1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/BaseJumpRateModelV2.sol#L172-L190), [2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/WhitePaperInterestRateModel.sol#L50-L57)] and takes no notice of the hard-coded cap, so it is very possible that this state will manifest, causing a major DoS due to most VToken functions calling `accrueInterest()` and `accrueInterest()` reverting.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change `VToken.accrueInterest()` to not revert in this case, but simply to set `borrowRateMantissa = borrowRateMaxMantissa` if the dynamically calculated value would be greater than the hard-coded max. This would:

1.  Allow execution to continue operating with the system-allowed maximum borrow rate, allowing all functionality that depends upon `accrueInterest()` to continue as normal.
2.  Allow `borrowRateMantissa` to be naturally set to the dynamically calculated rate as soon as that rate becomes less than the hard-coded max.

### Assessed type

DoS

## [[M-16] Sometimes calculateBorrowerReward and calculateSupplierReward return incorrect results](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/9)
*Submitted by [volodya](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/9)*

Sometimes `calculateBorrowerReward` and `calculateSupplierReward` return incorrect results.

### Proof of Concept

Whenever a user wants to know pending rewards they call `getPendingRewards`; sometimes, it returns incorrect results.

There is a bug inside `calculateBorrowerReward` and `calculateSupplierReward`

```solidity
    function calculateBorrowerReward(
        address vToken,
        RewardsDistributor rewardsDistributor,
        address borrower,
        RewardTokenState memory borrowState,
        Exp memory marketBorrowIndex
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        Double memory borrowIndex = Double({ mantissa: borrowState.index });
        Double memory borrowerIndex = Double({
            mantissa: rewardsDistributor.rewardTokenBorrowerIndex(vToken, borrower)
        });
//      @audit
//        if (borrowerIndex.mantissa == 0 && borrowIndex.mantissa >= rewardsDistributor.rewardTokenInitialIndex()) {
        if (borrowerIndex.mantissa == 0 && borrowIndex.mantissa > 0) {
            // Covers the case where users borrowed tokens before the market's borrow state index was set
            borrowerIndex.mantissa = rewardsDistributor.rewardTokenInitialIndex();
        }
        Double memory deltaIndex = sub_(borrowIndex, borrowerIndex);
        uint256 borrowerAmount = div_(VToken(vToken).borrowBalanceStored(borrower), marketBorrowIndex);
        uint256 borrowerDelta = mul_(borrowerAmount, deltaIndex);
        return borrowerDelta;
    }

```

[contracts/Lens/PoolLens.sol#L495](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/9853f6f4fe906b635e214b22de9f627c6a17ba5b/contracts/Lens/PoolLens.sol#L495)

```solidity
    function calculateSupplierReward(
        address vToken,
        RewardsDistributor rewardsDistributor,
        address supplier,
        RewardTokenState memory supplyState
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        Double memory supplyIndex = Double({ mantissa: supplyState.index });
        Double memory supplierIndex = Double({
            mantissa: rewardsDistributor.rewardTokenSupplierIndex(vToken, supplier)
        });
//      @audit
//        if (supplierIndex.mantissa == 0 && supplyIndex.mantissa  >= rewardsDistributor.rewardTokenInitialIndex()) {
        if (supplierIndex.mantissa == 0 && supplyIndex.mantissa > 0) {
            // Covers the case where users supplied tokens before the market's supply state index was set
            supplierIndex.mantissa = rewardsDistributor.rewardTokenInitialIndex();
        }
        Double memory deltaIndex = sub_(supplyIndex, supplierIndex);
        uint256 supplierTokens = VToken(vToken).balanceOf(supplier);
        uint256 supplierDelta = mul_(supplierTokens, deltaIndex);
        return supplierDelta;
    }

```

Inside `rewardsDistributor` original functions are written like this:

```solidity
    function _distributeSupplierRewardToken(address vToken, address supplier) internal {
...
        if (supplierIndex == 0 && supplyIndex >= rewardTokenInitialIndex) {
            // Covers the case where users supplied tokens before the market's supply state index was set.
            // Rewards the user with REWARD TOKEN accrued from the start of when supplier rewards were first
            // set for the market.
            supplierIndex = rewardTokenInitialIndex;
        }
...
    }
```

[contracts/Rewards/RewardsDistributor.sol#L340](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/9853f6f4fe906b635e214b22de9f627c6a17ba5b/contracts/Rewards/RewardsDistributor.sol#L340)

```solidity
    function _distributeBorrowerRewardToken(
        address vToken,
        address borrower,
        Exp memory marketBorrowIndex
    ) internal {
...
        if (borrowerIndex == 0 && borrowIndex >= rewardTokenInitialIndex) {
            // Covers the case where users borrowed tokens before the market's borrow state index was set.
            // Rewards the user with REWARD TOKEN accrued from the start of when borrower rewards were first
            // set for the market.
            borrowerIndex = rewardTokenInitialIndex;
        }
...
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

## [01] `PoolRegistry.supportMarket()` cannot be paused

Most actions in `PoolRegistry` can be paused, e.g. `_addToMarket()`, `exitMarket()`, `preMintHook()` etc.

Consider adding a "support" field in the enum Action and allowing `supportMarket()` to be paused. Not allowing `supportMarket()` to be paused could result in irregular behavior if everything else (mint, redeeming, borrowing enter market, exit market, etc) is paused but `supportMarket()` is open.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/ComptrollerStorage.sol#L44-L54

## [02] Lack of revert if price returned from oracle is zero

`RiskFund._swapAsset()` will not revert if `getUnderlyingPrice` if the price return zero.

This might be intended to avoid making the loop in `RiskFund.swapPoolAssets()` revert if a single swap is not done. However, it might be beneficial to revert the entire transaction, since price zero means the price is unavailable.

## [03] Solidity version

All contracts are using 0.8.13. Consider updating to the latest version 0.8.19 to ensure the compiler contains the latest security fixes.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Pool/PoolRegistry.sol#L2

## [04] State update after external calls

Consider making state updates prior to executing external calls to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L183

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L187

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L197-L199

## [05] Check for stale values on setter functions

Add a check ensuring that the new value is different than the old value to avoid emitting unnecessary events.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L702-L710

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L779-L792

## [06] Variable shadow

Consider renaming the input `accessControlManager` in `PoolRegistry.initialize()`. Currently, it's being shadowed by `AccessControlledV8.accessControlManager()`. This will get a warning on common linters/text editors.

Also, consider renaming the input "owner" in `VToken.allowance()` and `VToken.balanceOf()`, since it's being shadowed by `OwnableUpgradeable.owner()`.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Pool/PoolRegistry.sol#L170

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VToken.sol#L539

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VToken.sol#L548

## [07] Consistent usage of require vs custom error

Consider using the same approach throughout the codebase to improve the consistency of the code.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VToken.sol#L396

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VToken.sol#L489-L490

## [08] Avoid duplicated computation in `Comptroller.addRewardsDistributor()`

`uint256 rewardsDistributorsLen = rewardsDistributors.length;` can be removed and the `rewardsDistributorsLength` from L930 can be reused.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L940

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L930

## [09] Eslint warning in a solidity file

The comment on `Comptroller.preBorrowHook()` seems to have been intended for a js/ts test file. 

Consider removing it from the solidity source code or add a comment on why it needs to be there.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L323

## [10] Interchangeable usage of `msg.sender` and `vToken` in in `Comptroller.preBorrowCheck()`

Consider replacing `_addToMarket(VToken(msg.sender), borrower)` with `_addToMarket(VToken(vToken), borrower)`, since `msg.sender` will have to be equal `vToken` for `_checkSender(vToken)` to pass. This can improve code clarity.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L339-L342

## [11] Using underscore in a single struct field

Consider refactoring `kink_` to `kink`.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Pool/PoolRegistry.sol#L43

## [12] Uncommented fields in a struct

Consider adding comments for all the fields in a struct to improve the readability of the codebase.

Example with comments:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/ComptrollerStorage.sol#L29-L42

Example without comments:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/ComptrollerStorage.sol#L8-L27

## [13] Use return named variables or explicit returns consistently

Some functions are declaring returned named variables on the function header, while other functions are not defining returned named variables.

The following function does not declare a returned named variable:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Pool/PoolRegistry.sol#L379

The following function is using a return named variable in the function header:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Pool/PoolRegistry.sol#L222

Consider adopting the same approach throughout the codebase to improve the explicitness and readability of the code.

## Summary
A majority of the optimizations were benchmarked via the protocol's tests, i.e. using the following config: `solc version 0.8.13`, `optimizer on`, and `200 runs`. Optimizations that were not benchmarked are explained via EVM gas costs and opcodes.

Below are the overall average gas savings for the following tested functions, with all the optimizations applied:

| [G-16] | Use assembly to perform efficient back-to-back calls | 1 |

## [G-01] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared immutable
The solidity compiler will directly embed the values of immutable variables into your contract bytecode and therefore will save you from incurring a `Gsset (20000 gas)` when you set storage variables in the constructor; a `Gcoldsload (2100 gas)` when you access storage variables for the first time in a transaction, and a `Gwarmaccess (100 gas)` for each subsequent access to that storage slot.

Total Instances: `1`

Estimated Gas Saved: `1 * 2100 = 2100`

## [G-02] State variables can be packed to use fewer storage slots
The EVM works with 32 byte words. Variables less than 32 bytes can be declared next to each other in storage and this will pack the values together into a single 32 byte storage slot (if the values combined are <= 32 bytes). If the variables packed together are retrieved together in functions we will effectively save ~2000 gas with every subsequent SLOAD for that storage slot. This is due to us incurring a Gwarmaccess (100 gas) versus a Gcoldsload (2100 gas).

*There are 6 instances of this issue. (For in-depth details on this and all further gas optimizations with multiple instances, please see the warden's [full report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/538).)*

## [G-03] Structs can be packed to use fewer storage slots
The EVM works with 32 byte words. Variables less than 32 bytes can be declared next to each other in storage and this will pack the values together into a single 32 byte storage slot (if values combined are <= 32 bytes). If the variables packed together are retrieved together in functions (more likely with structs) we will effectively save ~2000 gas with every subsequent SLOAD for that storage slot. This is due to us incurring a Gwarmaccess (100 gas) versus a Gcoldsload (2100 gas).

*There are 40 instances of this issue.*

## [G-05] Cache state variables outside of loop to avoid reading storage on every iteration
Reading from storage should always try to be avoided within loops. In the following instances, we are able to cache state variables outside of the loop to save a `Gwarmaccess (100 gas)` per loop iteration.

## [G-06] Avoid emitting storage values
Caching of a state variable replaces each `Gwarmaccess (100 gas)` with a much cheaper stack read. We can avoid unnecessary SLOADs by caching storage values that were previously accessed and emitting those cached values.

*There are 9 instances of this issue.*

## [G-07] Use calldata instead of memory for function arguments that do not get mutated
When you specify a data location as memory, that value will be copied into memory. When you specify the location as calldata, the value will stay static within calldata. If the value is a large, complex type, using memory may result in extra memory expansion costs.

*There are 3 instances of this issue.*

## [G-08] Refactor internal function to avoid unnecessary SLOAD
The internal functions below read storage slots that are previously read in the functions that invoke them. We can refactor the internal functions so we could pass cached storage variables as stack variables and avoid the extra storage reads, which would otherwise take place in the internal functions.

*There are 3 instances of this issue.*

## [G-09] Return values from external calls can be cached to avoid unnecessary call
External calls are expensive as they use the `STATICCALL`/`CALL` opcode (~100 gas). If you are calling the same external function more than once you should cache the return value to avoid an unnecessary `STATICCALL`/`CALL`.

*There are 2 instances of this issue.*

## [G-10] A mapping is more efficient than an array
Fetching data from an array is more expensive than fetching data from a mapping. Fetching data from an array will require iterating over the array until you reach your desired data. When using a mapping you only need to know the key in order to fetch the data from the exact slot it is stored in. [Source](https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio/status/1464523336730480640)

*There are 2 instances of this issue.*

## [G-11] Move storage pointer to top of function to avoid offset calculation
We can avoid unnecessary offset calculations by moving the storage pointer to the top of the function.

## [G-13] Using storage instead of memory for structs/arrays saves gas
Using a memory pointer for a storage struct/array will effectively load all the fields of that data type from storage (SLOAD) into memory (MSTORE). Using a storage pointer will allow you to read specific fields from storage as you need them. If you are not going to use all of the fields of your data type then you should use a storage pointer so that you don't incur extra `Gcoldsload (2100 gas)` for fields that you will never use.

## [G-14] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a storage pointer
Caching a mapping's value in a storage pointer when the value is accessed multiple times saves ~40 gas per access due to not having to perform the same offset calculation every time. Help the Optimizer by saving a storage variable's reference instead of repeatedly fetching it.

To achieve this, declare a storage pointer for the variable and use it instead of repeatedly fetching the reference in a map or an array. As an example, instead of repeatedly calling `stakes[tokenId_]`, save its reference via a storage pointer: `StakeInfo storage stakeInfo = stakes[tokenId_]` and use the pointer instead.

*For all instances and in-depth details of this issue, please see the warden's [full report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus-findings/issues/538).*

## [G-15] Use `do while loops` instead of for loops
A `do while` loop will cost less gas since the condition is not being checked for the first iteration.

*There are 10 instances of this issue.*

## [G-16] Use assembly to perform efficient back-to-back calls
If a similar external call is performed back-to-back, we can use assembly to reuse any function signatures and function parameters that stay the same. In addition, we can also reuse the same memory space for each function call (`scratch space` + `free memory pointer` + `zero slot`), which can potentially allow us to avoid memory expansion costs.

**Note:** In order to do this optimization safely we will cache the free memory pointer value and restore it once we are done with our function calls. We will also set the zero slot back to 0 if necessary.
