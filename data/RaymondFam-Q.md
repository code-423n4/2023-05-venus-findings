## BNB chain halt
A blockchain halt, like the one that happened to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in October 2022, is a significant event. When a blockchain halts, it means that no new blocks are being produced, so no transactions can be confirmed. It's akin to a system-wide freeze.

The impact on smart contracts in such a situation would be substantial. Here's what could potentially happen:

1. Transactions would be stalled: Any transaction that's broadcast during the halt wouldn't get confirmed until the network resumes. This includes transactions that interact with smart contracts. If a user attempted to interact with one of the provided contracts during the halt, their transaction would be stuck in a pending state.

2. [Auctions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L158-L202) could be affected: In the given Auction contract, if the halt occurs during an ongoing auction, the auction would effectively be paused. No new bids could be placed, and the auction couldn't be finalized until the network resumes.

3. [Liquidations](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VToken.sol#L292-L299) would be paused: In the case of the Liquidation contract, no liquidations could occur during the halt. If a position becomes undercollateralized during the halt, it couldn't be liquidated until the network resumes.

4. Time-based logic could be distorted: The block.timestamp is the timestamp when the block was mined, which should be roughly the current time. However, during a blockchain halt, no new blocks are mined, so the block.timestamp doesn't advance. This could distort the logic of contracts that rely on the block.timestamp.

5. Borrowers were unable to [repay](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/VToken.sol#L292-L299) their loans, this could indeed potentially lead to their positions becoming undercollateralized, especially if the halt lasted for a significant period of time and interest continued to accrue. If the protocol's interest calculation is such that interest continues to accrue during a halt, and the halt lasts long enough for positions to become undercollateralized, then those positions could indeed be at risk of liquidation once the network resumes.

Once the blockchain resumes, there could be a rush of transactions as users try to interact with contracts that were paused during the halt. This could lead to increased gas prices and potential network congestion.

As a mitigation strategy, contracts could implement a pause functionality that allows them to be manually paused and unpaused in case of such emergencies. However, this introduces a degree of centralization and needs to be handled with care. Furthermore, users and developers on the network should be prepared for such events and have contingency plans in place such as kicking in a grace period for borrowers to rectify their positions.

## Missing crucial validation input
In Shortfall.placeBid, if `auction.auctionType == AuctionType.LARGE_RISK_FUND` and the user accidentally entered 0 bidBps, no one else would be so dumb to place another 0 bid anymore although technically `bidBps <= auction.startBidBps` would make it still permissible.

One of the simplest and most effective ways to prevent this kind of issue is to include input validation in the placeBid function. You could add a requirement that bidBps must be greater than 0. This would prevent a 0 bid from being placed and effectively breaking the auction while making the careless bidder bear the entire debt for zero exchange of [riskFundBidAmount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#LL244C13-L244C30).

Here is an example of how you could add this validation:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L158-L202

```diff
function placeBid(uint256 bidBps) public {
    // Input validation
+    require(bidBps > 0, "Bid must be greater than 0");

    // Existing logic
    ...
}
```
## Incorrect gap number
There are three (instead of two) state variables entailed in ReserveHelpers.sol. 

Consider having the gap number corrected refactored as follows:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/RiskFund/ReserveHelpers.sol#L13-L26

```diff
    mapping(address => uint256) internal assetsReserves;

    // Store the asset's reserve per pool in the ProtocolShareReserve.
    // Comptroller(pool) -> Asset -> amount
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) internal poolsAssetsReserves;

    // Address of pool registry contract
    address internal poolRegistry;

    /**
     * @dev This empty reserved space is put in place to allow future versions to add new
     * variables without shifting down storage in the inheritance chain.
     */
-    uint256[48] private __gap;
+    uint256[47] private __gap;
```
## Hard coded NO_ERROR
In Comptroller._safeGetAccountSnapshot(), `err` matches with the hard coded constant `NO_ERROR` which equals `0`.

Consider removing the redundant check:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1402C14-L1417

```diff
    function _safeGetAccountSnapshot(VToken vToken, address user)
        internal
        view
        returns (
            uint256 vTokenBalance,
            uint256 borrowBalance,
            uint256 exchangeRateMantissa
        )
    {
        uint256 err;
        (err, vTokenBalance, borrowBalance, exchangeRateMantissa) = vToken.getAccountSnapshot(user);
-        if (err != 0) {
-            revert SnapshotError(address(vToken), user);
-        }
        return (vTokenBalance, borrowBalance, exchangeRateMantissa);
    }
```
## `maxLoopsLimit` could directionally make for loops prone to DoS  
[MaxLoopsLimitHelper._setMaxLoopsLimit()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/MaxLoopsLimitHelper.sol#L25-L32) can only set a limit higher than the existing `maxLoopsLimit`. In the event `maxLoopsLimit` was accidentally overvalued, there would not be an option to downsize it. As a result, all functions dependent on [`_ensureMaxLoops()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/MaxLoopsLimitHelper.sol#L39C14-L43) could easily run out of gas in their loop iterations. Although a smaller array could always be inputted, it would disrupt calls having had to self gauge the supposed `maxLoopLimit`.

Consider flexibly making `_setMaxLoopsLimit()` to set a lower `maxLoopLimit` if need be by removing the require check:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/MaxLoopsLimitHelper.sol#L25-L32

```diff
    function _setMaxLoopsLimit(uint256 limit) internal {
-        require(limit > maxLoopsLimit, "Comptroller: Invalid maxLoopsLimit");

        uint256 oldMaxLoopsLimit = maxLoopsLimit;
        maxLoopsLimit = limit;

        emit MaxLoopsLimitUpdated(oldMaxLoopsLimit, maxLoopsLimit);
    }
```
