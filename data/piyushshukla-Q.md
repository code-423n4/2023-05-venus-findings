Keccak Constant values should used to immutable rather than constant

There is a difference between constant variables and immutable variables, and they should each be used in their appropriate contexts.

While it doesn’t save any gas because the compiler knows that developers often make this mistake, it’s still best to use the right tool for the task at hand.

   /// @notice The EIP-712 typehash for the contract's domain
    bytes32 public constant DOMAIN_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256("EIP712Domain(string name,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)");

    /// @notice The EIP-712 typehash for the ballot struct used by the contract
    bytes32 public constant BALLOT_TYPEHASH = keccak256("Ballot(uint256 proposalId,uint8 support)");
