## Finding 1: Incorrect event parameter in closeAuction function


The event `AuctionStarted` emitted everytime a new auction started, where `marketsDebts` param represent an array of debt own by each market. 
```solidity
    event AuctionStarted(
        address indexed comptroller,
        uint256 auctionStartBlock,
        AuctionType auctionType,
        VToken[] markets,
        uint256[] marketsDebt,
        uint256 seizedRiskFund,
        uint256 startBidBps
    );
```

However, when an auction get closed, it emits the same `marketsDebts` parameter, but here it returns the debt that has been recovered, not the debt which own by each market out there currently.

```solidity
    /// @notice Emitted when a auction is completed
    event AuctionClosed(
        address indexed comptroller,
        uint256 auctionStartBlock,
        address indexed highestBidder,
        uint256 highestBidBps,
        uint256 seizedRiskFind,
        VToken[] markets,
        uint256[] marketDebt
    );
```

It may affect negatively the off-chain tools that monitoring the badDebt of the markets. 

**Recommendation**

Fetch the new `badDebt` for each individual market, and update it into `marketDebt`. Do the same ways it doing in [_startAuction()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/8be784ed9752b80e6f1b8b781e2e6251748d0d7e/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L389C29-L399).
